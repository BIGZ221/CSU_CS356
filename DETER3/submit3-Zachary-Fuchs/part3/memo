1.	The security flaw  inside FCCU.php occured as a result of not validating the inputs
	for the user's id and password. Thorugh not checking an attacker is able to input their
	own SQL and log into any account they want. Doing so the Attacker is able to transfer
	the entire balance of another user's account into another but they are unable to create
	accounts or update the balances of an arbitrary account.
2.	I would fix this flaw by including input validation to make sure the id field contained
	only numbers on line 31. I would also implement a way to escape special characters from 
	the password on line 32	entered by the user since the password field can also be abused
	by the attacker to gain access to accounts without authorization. This fixes the flaw
	since the attack mainly occurs as a result of input from the id and password fields.
	Limiting the id field to numbers is a good solution since the id cannot be anything other
	than numbers so if a non-number is entered it is obvious that its an attempted attack.
	Escaping special characters in the password fixes the attack by disabling the attackers 
	ability to inject SQL code without limiting the users ability to have a secure password.
	On line 31 you could use the PHP filter_var() function. with second parameter 
	FILTER_VALIDATE_NUMBER_INT. On Line 32 you could use mysqli_read_escape_string() 
	function or you could fix the vulnerability by using prepared statements.
3.	This breach was relatively serious given that the attacker had access to potentially every
	account within the system but was unable to create new accounts or arbitrarily update account
	balances. This attack did not allow the attacker root access either. To secure the server
	the injection exploits should be patched using input validation and should be inspected for
	further potential security exploits.
