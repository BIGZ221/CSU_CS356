Caspian Siebert:
	Caspian was responsible for working on the Filesystem Exploit portion
	of Deter3 Lab. Caspian was successful in discovering and abusing the
	file system exploit in part 2 while keeping the team notified about
	any issues that occured and how we could help. Caspian was a good team
	member and helped accomplish all goals we had for the project. Overall
	I am happy with the results of this lab and had a fun time working with
	Caspian.
Ryan Anderson: 
	Ryan was responsible for working on the Buffer Overflow portion
	of Deter3 Lab. In the buffer overflow Ryan successfully discovered
	and attacked the server using the buffer overflow vulnerability.
	As a team member Ryan did his work in a timely manner and communicated
	with Caspian and I about which part of the project he wanted to work
	on as well as any issues he ran into while doing part 1. Overall Ryan
	was a good teammate and we all accomplished the goals we set out to when
	forming the group for this lab.
